    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>Effective Date: {% now "F j, Y" %}</p> <p>This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and handle your information when you use our Meshtastic dashboard service ("Service").</p>

    <h3 class="mt-3">Information We Collect</h3>
    <p>When you use our Service, we collect the following data originating from Meshtastic devices:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device Data:</strong> This includes telemetry data from Meshtastic devices, such as GPS location, altitude, speed, battery level, channel utilization, air utilization, and other sensor readings connected to the devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Sensor Data:</strong> Any data transmitted by sensors integrated with or connected to the Meshtastic devices that are relayed through the network.</li>
        <li><strong>Node Messages:</strong> Messages transmitted between Meshtastic nodes. If these messages are transmitted without end-to-end encryption via the network segments monitored by this Service, their content will be collected and stored. We strongly encourage users to utilize end-to-end encryption for private communications.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="mt-3">How We Use Information</h3>
    <p>The collected data is used for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide and maintain the dashboard Service.</li>
        <li>To display network activity, device locations, and message history.</li>
        <li>For public analysis and monitoring of the Meshtastic network activity accessible through this dashboard.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="mt-3">Data Accessibility and Sharing</h3>
    <p><strong>All data collected by this Service, including device data, sensor data, and the content of unencrypted node messages (as processed by this Service), is publicly accessible through this dashboard.</strong> Users should be aware of this public accessibility when transmitting information over the Meshtastic network that is routed through or monitored by our Service.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-3">Data Retention</h3>
    <p>All collected data, as described above, will be stored for a period of <strong>one (1) month</strong> from the time of collection. After this period, the data will be permanently deleted from our systems.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-3">Data Security</h3>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the information we collect. However, as the data is made publicly accessible by design of this Service, users should not have an expectation of privacy for unencrypted data transmitted via the Meshtastic network and subsequently collected and displayed by this Service.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-3">Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
